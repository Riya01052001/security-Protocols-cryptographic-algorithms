**Security Protocols**- 
- These are sets of rules and procedures designed to ensure secure communication between devices or systems.
- They facilitate secure data transmission over networks, protecting against unauthorized access, data tampering, or eavesdropping.Some common protocols include:
  
# Transport Layer Security(TLS)/Secure Sockets Layer(SSL) - 
Encrypts data transmitted between servers and clients, commonly used for securing web traffic(HTTPS).
# IPsec(Internet Protocol Security) - 
Provides security at the network layer by encrypting and authenticating IP packets, commonly used in VPNs(Virtual Private Networks).
# SSh(Secure Shell) - 
Encrypts network services and provides secure remote access to systems.
# PGP(Pretty Good Privacy / GPG(GNU Privacy Guard) - 
Used for encrypting and decrypting email messages and files, ensuring privacy and authenticity.

**Cryptographic Algorithms**-
-Cryptographic algorithms are mathematical functions used in encryption and decryption processes to secure data.They come in various types:

# Symmetric Encryption -
Uses a single key for both encryption and decryption.
# Asymmetric Encryption -
Utilizes a pair of keys for encryption and decryption.
# Hash Functions -
These algorithms generate fixed-size outputs from variable-sized inputs.
# Digital Signatures -
These algorithms use asymmetric encryption to provide authentication and non-repudiation.
